I created this website for a carpenter friend.

The carpenter wanted:
- The website had a very minimalist design
-The website had a subpage on business cooperation
- The website contained information on the services provided by his company.

To create this website I used technologies such as:
-HTML, CSS, JS
- Gulp, Scss,
- BEM methodology

Due to the fact that it was one of my first pages that I created, I learned a lot of basics such as:
- using flexbox properties to create responsive websites.
- Sending an email using php
- Location sharing from google maps using iframe
- Using external libraries such as swiper.js and aos.js
- Js basics that allow this page to handle navigation and picture galleries.

I've already learned a lot when I published the website on the internet,
I tested this website on various tools to check the speed of the page or optimize for seo, the results were not bad, but after delving into the topic of optimization and reading many articles on this topic, I made many corrections that significantly improved the quality of the page, and these were corrections such as :

- limiting the critical rendering path by separating the css styles and pasting into the header tag, and significantly thinning and placing the link in front of the body tag that the fontawesome library downloads.
- Redirects to the address: https://kongrod.pl/ from various other links, such as: www.kongrod.pl
- adding a robots.txt file and a sitemap (although it is not necessary for such small pages)
- optimizing the headers, e.g. so that the h4 tag is not greater than h3, and that the h1, h2 and h3 tags contain keywords.
- adding tools such as google analytics
- and many other little things that I have introduced and will introduce
